Here are some practice questions related to the `print()` function in Python. Try solving them to strengthen your understanding:

### **Basic Questions**

1. **Simple Output**
   Write a Python program that prints the following output:

   ```
   Hello, Python!
   ```

2. **Multiple Values**
   Print the following output in one `print()` statement:
   `5 apples and 3 bananas.`

3. **Printing Variables**
   Create two variables, `x = 10` and `y = 20`, and print the following:
   `The values of x and y are 10 and 20.`

### **Intermediate Questions**

4. **Using `sep` Parameter**
   Print the numbers `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` separated by a hyphen (`-`), like this:
   `1-2-3-4`

5. **Using `end` Parameter**
   Write a Python program to print the following:

   ```
   I am learning
   Python.
   ```

   Ensure that the output is printed on two lines without using a `\n` directly.

6. **Formatted String Output**
   Use an f-string to print the following output:
   `My name is John and I am 25 years old.`
   The variables `name` and `age` should store `"John"` and `25` respectively.

### **Advanced Questions**

7. **Printing a List**
   You have a list of numbers:
   `numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`
   Write a program to print this list as:
   `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` without manually formatting the list.

8. **Redirect Output to a File**
   Write a Python program that prints "Hello, File!" to a text file named `greeting.txt`.

9. **Using `flush` Parameter**
   Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 5, with a 1-second delay between each print, and ensures the output is immediately displayed without buffering.

10. **Printing Special Characters**
    Write a program that prints the following output:

```
He said, "Python is awesome!"
```

Make sure to handle the quotes properly using escape sequences.
