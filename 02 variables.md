Here are some practice questions on **variable assignment** in Python, ranging from simple to intermediate-level tasks.

---

### **1. Simple Variable Assignment:**

**Task:**
Assign the value `42` to a variable named `num`, and assign your favorite color to a variable `color` as a string.

```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### **2. Multiple Assignment:**

**Task:**
Assign the values `5`, `10`, and `15` to three variables `a`, `b`, and `c` in one line.

```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### **3. Swapping Two Variables:**

**Task:**
Swap the values of two variables `x` and `y` without using a third variable. For example, if `x = 3` and `y = 7`, after the swap, `x` should be `7` and `y` should be `3`.

```python
x = 3
y = 7
# Write your code here to swap x and y
```

---

### **4. Assigning Values Based on Expressions:**

**Task:**
Create two variables `width` and `height`. Assign the values `5` and `10` to them, respectively. Then, create a new variable `area` that calculates the area of a rectangle (width \* height).

```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### **5. Working with Lists:**

**Task:**
Create a list `fruits` with the items `"apple"`, `"banana"`, and `"cherry"`. Then, change the second element of the list (index 1) to `"orange"`, and print the list.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# Write your code here
```

---

### **6. Variable Reassignment:**

**Task:**
Assign the value `25` to a variable `age`. Then, reassign `age` to `30`. Finally, print the value of `age`.

```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### **7. Multiple Variables with the Same Value:**

**Task:**
Assign the value `100` to three variables `x`, `y`, and `z` in one line.

```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### **8. Assigning to Dictionary Keys:**

**Task:**
Create a dictionary `person` with keys `"name"` and `"age"`. Assign `"John"` to `"name"` and `28` to `"age"`. Then, print the dictionary.

```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### **9. Type Changing During Reassignment:**

**Task:**
Create a variable `var` and assign it an integer value `10`. Then, reassign `var` to a string `"Hello"`, and print `var`.

```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### **10. Calculating Total Price:**

**Task:**
Assign the price of an item (`12.50`) to a variable `item_price`. Then, calculate the total price for 5 items and assign the result to a new variable `total_price`. Finally, print the `total_price`.

```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### **Bonus Challenge:**

### **11. Finding the Largest Number:**

**Task:**
Assign three numbers to variables `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`. Then, create a new variable `largest` that holds the largest of the three numbers. (Hint: Use conditional statements or the `max()` function.)

```python
num1 = 15
num2 = 20
num3 = 10
# Write your code here
```
